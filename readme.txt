Livefyre’s StreamHub platform helps brands, media companies and agencies engage consumers through a combination of real-time conversation, content, social curation and advertising. With StreamHub, brands can integrate real-time content into their websites, mobile apps, advertisements, jumbotrons and television broadcasts to increase viewer engagement, boost website traffic and drive revenue.

*[LiveComments™](http://web.livefyre.com/streamhub/#liveComments)*

Turn every piece of content into a real-time conversation with LiveComments™. Livefyre leads the market with a robust feature set including truly real-time posts, mobile compatibility, SEO optimized content, social login, listener count and a comment notifier. And with media-rich embedding options, users can post videos, songs, images and more, right into the comment stream.

*[LiveBlog™](http://web.livefyre.com/streamhub/#liveBlog)*

Become the live news source.

Feature real-time updates and images from your site’s own editors when covering a live event and turn your site into an engaging news source. This is a great option for multiple editors who will be reporting from live events including product reveals, award programs, television premieres, sporting events and press conferences. For the new XBox launch, Gamespot hosted a LiveBlog™ that featured photos, live coverage and analysis from designated bloggers on-location. As a result of this engaging real-time coverage, there were over 30,000 listeners on the site during the announcement.

*[LiveChat™](http://web.livefyre.com/streamhub/#liveChat)*

Spark real-time conversation about live events.

Audiences can engage in real-time conversation surrounding live events, announcements and entertainment shows. Content appears as a continuous, real-time stream of unthreaded conversation to facilitate rapid conversation and maximize energy on a page.

*[Sidenotes™](http://web.livefyre.com/streamhub/#liveSidenotes)*

Focused comments. In context. Anywhere on the page.

Sidenotes inspires more focused conversations by allowing readers to engage directly with content — a quote, a paragraph, an image — anywhere on a page. By inviting readers to interact and share your content as they read, Sidenotes lowers the barrier for engagement, increases time on site and can boost conversational civility.
 
Sidenotes is mobile-ready, SEO optimized, and is included with every subscription to LiveComments and Community Comments.

*Comments*

Livefyre Community Comments replaces your default comments with real-time conversations. Our social integration features make it easy to capture all the conversations going on about your posts across Twitter and Facebook, and pull your friends into the conversation. Features include:

* SocialSync: When sharing links to your blog posts on Twitter and Facebook, replies and comments there are synced with the comments section on your blog, where they can be replied to and interacted with.
* Social Sign-In: Readers can sign in with multiple social networks to jump into the conversation.
* Friend Tagging: Notify friends on social networks by using the @ sign with their names in comments.
* Comment Sharing and Comment Liking
* Rich Text Editor for emphasizing and organizing words in comments
* Additional editing, notification and admin features outlined at livefyre.com/comments

*Sidenotes*

Allow readers to add annotation-style comments to any part of a blog post, allowing bloggers and readers to annotate content in a simple, mobile-friendly interface. Features:

* Allow your blog readers to directly interact with content anywhere on the page, highlighting text or images and then annotating them.
* Sidenotes are designed to work with any content div on a page - paragraphs, images, etc.
* Readers can vote Sidenotes up or down, with the most popular Sidenotes appearing at the top of the list.
* Sidenotes can be flagged by users to maintain quality discourse.
* Users can share Sidenotes with their social networks (such as Twitter and Facebook). Anyone who clicks the Sidenotes link will be taken directly to the originating Sidenote in your post.
* Sidenotes are retained even when content they’re attached to is modified, although they are deleted if the content is completely removed.
* Sidenotes can be used, read and shared from any iOS or Android mobile device.

*Admin Dashboard for Livefyre Apps*

Livefyre’s centralized admin dashboard allows you to track and monitor every Sidenote or Livefyre Comment on your blog from one location, and includes features like spam protection, community flagging, comment editing, moderator notes, multiple moderator access, user whitelisting or banning, profanity lists, user activity and moderation reports.

*What if I have older Livefyre plugins installed, such as the separate Livefyre Comments or Livefyre Sidenotes plugins?*

Livefyre Apps is a new plugin which combines the options from all of these. While older plugins will still work, they will not be updated moving forward, so it's recommended that you deactivate these and activate Livefyre Apps to continue using their functionality and receive the latest updates from Livefyre moving forward. Over time, older plugins will no longer be supported.

*Do I have to activate and use all Livefyre Apps on my blog?*

No. All available Livefyre Apps can be toggled on or off at any time with this plugin, allowing you to use them in any combination needed.

*Do Sidenotes count as comments that sync to the WordPress database?*

No. Sidenotes are connected to the content on the page, and do not sync with or replace WordPress’ default comments. Unlike Livefyre Comments, you will not see Sidenotes data go into your WordPress database.

*Are Sidenotes mobile friendly?*

Yes! Sidenotes can be created and read on all Android and iOS devices.

*What if I change the content a Sidenote is on?*

Sidenotes can be attached to paragraphs, images or specific words in a post. If you edit, modify or move that content, its Sidenotes will remain attached to it. If you delete the content altogether, you will also delete the Sidenotes attached to it.

*Is there someone I can contact if I’m seeing an issue?*

Sure! We recognize that many custom WordPress themes and configurations exist, so if seeing any issues while getting Sidenotes integrated onto yours, feel free to visit [Livefyre FAQ](http://support.livefyre.com) or e-mail us at
support@livefyre.com, and we’ll be happy to help.
